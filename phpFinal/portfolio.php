					<p>Hi there! My name is Cole and if you've found this then the game is up.
					Which is convenient as I am an aspiring game designer. Not quite it the hobbyist way,
					they likely have more content for you to play, but it the I am attending graduate school
					for a degree way. It would be easier and, hopefully, more interesting for you to learn more 
					about my work and interests by exploring my blog.</p>
					<p>I also dabble in other design works so 
					please check out my ugly box to see half completed projects that are usually born of half-baked
					ideas.</p>

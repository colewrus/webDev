				<h2>Welcome to the Game:</br>Mechanics Shape the Community of Play</h2>

				<p>Hi there! My name is Cole and if you've found this then the game is up.
				Which is convenient as I am an aspiring game designer. Not quite it the hobbyist way,
				they likely have more content for you to play, but it the I am attending graduate school
				for a degree way. It would be easier and, hopefully, more interesting for you to learn more 
				about my work and interests by exploring my blog.</p>
				<p>I also dabble in other design works so 
				please check out my ugly box to see half completed projects that are usually born of half-baked
				ideas.</p>	
				
				<h3>Do People Suck? Or Games?</h3>
				
				<p>There's a curious reaction by many players to immediately label any given game community
				"toxic" which is not always untrue but doesn't actually say much about the community itself or the game.
				<i>Rust</i> is a game of iteration, the forced developer wipes of all servers make this an absolute, it is the proverbial
				"death and taxes" of the game world. This iteration is a key part of the play philosophy created by the community
				through the mechanics.</p> 
				
				<p>There are only incentives to kill individuals on sight in <i>Rust</i> because the unarmed and naked man
				running through your front yard can suddenly equip full armor and pull out a rocket launcher (we don't ask where it's hidden). 
				Thus the community is one of perpetual mistrust. End game goals consist of building the largest most impenetrable Fort Knox and then
				breaking into someone else's large impenetrable Fort Knox.</p>
				
				<p>Ideally the end game of <i>Rust</i> would be driven by player drama as space to build disappears and fights over the limited
				land break out. It's not to say that the late game raiding that currently exists doesn't contribute to that, but there is no room
				in the middle for those to contribute to warring groups. So instead of factions you have very small gangs who vandalize bases
				and trick out their hideout with their spoils. No society, grand strategy, or economy. And not to say that every game needs to reach
				for the stars<sup>sorry</sup> like <i>Eve</i> but the immense complexity of CCP's literal universe allows for varied styles and levels of play.</p>
